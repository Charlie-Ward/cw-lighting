A Christmas Caroline is a modern-day reimagining of Charles Dickens' classic A Christmas Carol. The story follows Caroline, a wealthy and cold-hearted owner of a multi-million-dollar clothing company who has little regard for others. In a final attempt to save her, her deceased business partner Molly appears as a ghost, warning Caroline that she will be visited by three "emos" who will show her the past, present, and future of her life. If Caroline fails to change her ways, she will face a miserable and lonely existence after her death. As Caroline confronts her own choices and the consequences of her actions, she must decide whether to embrace compassion and change her path before itâ€™s too late. The play blends dark humor, modern sensibilities, and a timeless message about the importance of empathy and personal growth.
