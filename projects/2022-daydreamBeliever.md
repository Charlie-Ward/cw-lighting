In a futuristic dystopia where children are addicted to screens and Amazon controls everything — including education — Santa is struggling to keep his North Pole workshop running. The elves are threatening to strike over the new poor working conditions.<br />

Enter Jeff Bezos, disguised as Mick from Mick's Chippy, who secretly plans to use Santa as a new delivery method for Amazon's empire. He takes three kids (Jean, Frank and Charlie) on a journey to the North Pole, where Santa and the elves are hard at work. When they finally find Santa, Mick reveals his true identity as Jeff Bezos and pitches his idea of turning Santa into Amazon's personal delivery system showcasing his plans for total control.<br />

Santa reluctantly agrees to Jeff's proposal, but soon grows tired and frustrated, realizing he's being exploited and treated poorly. As Santa begins to wear down under Jeff's demands, Jean, Frank and Charlie stand up to Jeff, rallying the elves and Santa in a bold act of defiance.<br />

In a final act of rebellion, Santa and the children break free from Amazon’s control and dismantle the oppressive educational system, freeing all children from the grasp of the Supreme Teacher. With a triumphant soundtrack full of 60s songs to match the rebellion, this musical celebrates the power of unity, freedom, and standing up against exploitation.<br />
