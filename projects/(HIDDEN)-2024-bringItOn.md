Campbell is cheer-royalty at Truman High School and her senior year should prove the most cheertastic — she's been named captain of the squad! But, an unexpected redistricting has forced her to spend her final year of high school at the neighboring Jackson High School. Despite having the deck stacked against her, Campbell befriends the school's dance crew. Together with their headstrong and hardworking leader, Danielle, they form a powerhouse squad for the ultimate competition — the National Championships.
